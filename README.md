- **Environment variables** (can be stored in `.env` for local dev):
  ```bash
  SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
  FLASK_ENV=development  # use 'production' in production
  FLASK_DEBUG=False      # ensure debug is off for production
  ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@thehub.com
  ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

## Installation & Setup

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hubkinza/thehub.git
   cd thehub
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   python
   >>> from app import db_object, my_app
   >>> with my_app.app_context(): db_object.create_all()
   >>> exit()
   ```

5. **Run the app locally for testing:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access locally at** `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

> **Note:** Debug mode can be toggled with `debug=True/False` in `app.py`.

## Production Deployment (AWS EC2 + Gunicorn + Nginx)

### 1. Server Setup

- Launch an Ubuntu 24.04 EC2 instance and clone the repository.
- Create a Python virtual environment (venv) and install dependencies.
- Configure environment variables in `.env` or system environment.

### 2. Configure Gunicorn Service

Create a Gunicorn systemd service at `/etc/systemd/system/thehub.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=TheHub Flask Application
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/thehub
Environment="DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db"
Environment="SECRET_KEY=mykey"
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/thehub/venv/bin/gunicorn -w 3 -b 127.0.0.1:8000 app:my_app
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### 3. Start Gunicorn Service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable thehub
sudo systemctl start thehub
sudo systemctl status thehub
```

### 4. Configure Nginx

Create an Nginx configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/thehub`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_or_IP;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    
    location /static/ {
        alias /home/ubuntu/thehub/static/;
    }
}
```

### 5. Enable Nginx Site

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/thehub /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Production Notes

- Static files are served directly by Nginx for performance.
- Ensure `debug=False` in `app.py` for production.
- Connect to the production database as specified in `DATABASE_URL`.
